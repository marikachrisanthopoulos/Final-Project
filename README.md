# Final-Project

## Individual Self-Assessment

### Self-Assessment
Considering I completed the project on my own, I feel as though I worked hard to complete all of the required items in each deliverable. My biggest challenges included my intensive work schedule interfering with class/homework time, and not being able to complete this project with a group, like most students.

### Summary of Project
This project analyzed characteristics of dogs that were put up for adoption from an initial dataset of almost 3,000 animals. Various statistical analyses were performed, including unsupervised machine learning models, chi-squared tests, and summary statistics. Many languages/platforms were used, including Python/Pandas in Jupyter Notebook, R in RStudio, and more. Data was stored in a databse hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
