In order to ensure all the work for each deliverable is completed correctly, different branches will be used for each deliverable (ex: all the work for this first deliverable will be in the branch "Deliverable_1." After completion of the entire project, all of the necessary materials from each deliverable will be merged.

Due to challenges and time constraints at my job (losing multiple staff members and being promoted during this exact transitional time, resulting in my having to take on the work of two positions at once), I am completing this project on my own. I have taken time off work (as we finally had a new employee start two weeks ago who can take on some of my responsibilities) to complete this project and any outstanding work for this class that I have fallen behind on.
